# String manipulation and code intelligence
# you can do a same things
# print("Hello World!\nHello World!\nHello World!")
# separated by \n
# concatenate

# print("Hello" + " " + "Deva")
# these two strings combined into one
# how can i add a space in between?
# add another blank string

# String concatenation
# merge them into one

print("Hello" + " " + "Deva")

# unexpected indent
# any tabs or spaces.. -> indentation error

# last error: syntax error

# code intelligence -> auto complete hints -> her own platform

# catch the errors and how to classify the error message
# pick out the errors

# let's start debugging exercise
